ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Asya Shepunova. 
For the last 7 years, Iâ€™ve been passionate about advancing data science and technology.
After working as an event manager for data science meetups at Yandex in Moscow, I realized I want to do data science myself. 
I took an 8-month break to retool and moved to Silicon Valley to find my dream job in data science and analytics.
