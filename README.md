ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Asya Shepunova. 
For the last 7 years, Iâ€™ve been passionate about advancing data science and technology.
After working in science communication and running tech events, where I combined a love for tech with a deep dive into machine learning, I have shifted focus to data science, fine-tuning my machine learning skills through practical projects and studying statistics and probability to build a theoretical foundation.
